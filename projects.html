        The Malnad Technical Club dawned with the concept of serving as a hub
        for tech enthusiasts to explore their innovative ideas and projects.
        Every year, the club members are divided into teams and develop projects
        to have a better comprehension of new age technology which helps cater
        to the needs of the current generation. It also encourages teamwork and
        explores the brilliant ideas in young minds.

              An Ardino-controlled autonomous robot that senses and overcomes
              obstacles on it's path. This project finds its applications in the
              field of navigation, mining and many more. The robot is controlled
              by an ultrasonic sensor. Depending on the input signal received,
              the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate
              direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it
              through a motor driver
